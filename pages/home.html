<h4 class="txt">Here is a list of nine  benefits that task tracking software will bring to your agency:</h4>
<br>

<hr>
<div id="p">

<p>1. Manage all your work/accounts in one place.</p>

<p>Task tracking software allows you to integrate and manage all tools and activities in one place. No need to remember multiple usernames, passwords, URLs and what not. All of your projects and processes are right there in front of you, on one big, user-friendly platform. Whether you are working on a few low-priority tasks, some personal to-do's or a single large project, task tracking software will make your life a lot easier.</p>
<p>
Real life example:
<br>
<p>
Concordia University, the largest university in Canada in terms of enrollment, was struggling to keep up with the task management, assignments and implementation.
</p>
<p>
The university was using a custom solution called Filemaker Pro, but as the team grew it became rather impossible to manage the tasks. They went back to paper and printers and had to spend a ton of time and resources on printing every task on paper and handing it to each employee individually. As quoted “We were spending a lot of time printing and handing out tasks to team members. You can imagine how time consuming that was - plus it was a big waste of paper.”
</p>
<p>
They needed a solution that would be:
</p>
<p>
A collaborative tool
</p>
<p>
Easy to adapt and scale across the organization
</p>
<p>
Provide a traceable workflow
</p>
<p>
Manage all tasks in a single place
</p>
<p>
Flexible and customizable to fit their needs
</p>
<p>
With the implementation of a professional project management software, Concordia University was able to:
</p>
<p>
Have a sustainable, paperless environment
</p>
<p>
Improve collaboration
</p>
<p>
Plan resource allocation and availability
</p>
<p>
Save 24000+ hours a year
</p>
<p>
All of this is a result of the one single point: keeping everything in one place. It saves so much time and trouble for any organization that the benefits simply cannot be ignored.
</p>
<p>
“I want everything logged in Easy Projects, I want everything in there - from the original request, the drafts to the revisions that are requested because that way I can show my boss everything. That’s been a big thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Aside from the time-saving aspect, I think it’s having everything in one place, to make sure that bits of paper don’t get lost, emails don’t get deleted, well, stuff gets deleted out of EP as well, but really not the way an email can slip through the cracks, right? It made the workflow more efficient. The end result is that we’re actually making more stuff done instead of less."
</p>
<p>
2. Prioritize tasks
</p>
<p>
Understanding which tasks are more important than others may seem simple, but it’s easy to get lost in the process when you have so much work to do. You start your workday in the morning and sometimes get lost in the completion of small, low priority tasks, which leave the important ones for another day. This can lead to missing deadlines or not getting the job done the right way, simply because of poor management. Task tracking allows you to prioritize your tasks and get the most important ones out of the way quickly and efficiently.
</p>
<p>
3. Team collaboration
</p>
<p>
Any form of marketing is a team effort, nobody can do it alone. With task tracking, team collaboration becomes easy. Discuss tasks, brainstorm on various topics, make real-time task updates together with your team and never forget an important idea. The best part is, you can always access the brainstorming sessions and review all the stored ideas/information anytime you want.
</p>
<p>
4. Share the workload
</p>
<p>
Managing a group of 10+ people isn’t easy. You will have to keep track of each person’s workload to know when to give more tasks to this person or delegate some tasks to others. There might be cases when an employee is assigned so many tasks at once, that it just becomes impossible to do everything on time, while ensuring high quality. Use the software to monitor all the tasks assigned to employees and share the workload wisely.
</p>
<p>
5. Eliminate geographic barriers
</p>
<p>
Are you an international agency? Is one of your team members out of country? Maybe he or she is out of office and something urgent needs to be delivered ASAP? Task tracking software allows you to bypass all of these issues. Put everybody on the same page concerning each task by providing live updates and changes. There’s no need to wait another day or two for a teammate to return to the office - simply update the task online and you’re good to go.
</p>
<p>
Real life example:
</p>
<p>
Nick Basket, the managing director of Matta Consulting on the cross border teamwork:
</p>
<p>
“We did a comprehensive review of project management systems, and required a cross-platform solution that we could deploy across borders, and that was easy to use. Easy Projects stood out from the other solutions we looked at.
</p>
<p>
In using it, we have not been disappointed, it has genuinely made a significant contribution towards solving our problems in cross-border communication on high-value projects. The integration of timesheets and billing has in particular been useful.”
</p>
<p>
6. Manage deadlines
</p>
<p>
When you are bombarded with a ton of tasks, it’s easy to get lost. There is no surprise that some deadlines might not be met due to lack of time, inefficient management or simply forgetting.. When you use task tracking software, you’ll be able to significantly minimize the risk by allowing your team to set reminders and ensure that nothing falls through the cracks.
</p>
<p>
7. Track time spent on tasks
</p>
<p>
Track every minute and hour spent on each task by each employee. With this information available, you can understand what assignments need more time than usual so you can plan your next similar project accordingly. It’s also a good way to estimate employee productivity. For example, if one of your employees takes considerably more time to complete a task than another one, you can consider reassigning tasks for maximum productivity.
</p>
<p>
Real life example:
</p>
<p>
Founded in 1994, CyberMark has been helping businesses grow their profits using online marketing. Despite the fact of people not having much trust in the online world at that time, CyberMark continuously helped its clients grow with professional SEO services, PPC advertising, social media marketing and more. As this is an hourly waged business, every minute mattered.
</p>
<p>
As CyberMark founder Kimberly Judd-Pennie said “Prior to Easy Projects we used a custom built system (PHP/MySQL), supplemented with spreadsheets and databases (Excel/Access/SQL). It was obviously fragmented and it lacked the features we needed and we had no time to build those features. We had many challenges, however time tracking was one of the major challenges we needed a solution for. In our business, we bill on an hourly rate so we needed a robust system that could handle over 400 projects and thousands of tasks.”
</p>
<p>
The need for an easy customizable solution had reached a point, where it could no longer be ignored. After two years of long and troublesome search the company settled with their choice of EasyProjects. The time saving and customizable advantages were absolutely mind blowing.
</p>
<p>
“We recently implemented one of our processes directly into Easy Projects. It eliminated a process that we ran through spreadsheets. We estimate that it will save us 1-2 hours per project just in set-up time. The customizable nature of Easy Projects is what really helped improve our workflow. It is highly adaptable. If an internal processes changes, we’re confident that Easy Projects will be able to adapt. If something doesn’t work for you right out of the box, 9 times out of 10 you will be able to make a few easy customizations to solve your issue.”
</p>
<p>
8. Save more time on follow ups
</p>
<p>
When you assign a task to an employee, it’s important to follow up to check progress, ensure the tasks are proceeding smoothly, deadlines will be met and more. Each of these follow-ups take time, and  you have to remember every follow up yourself. With task tracking,  you won’t have to ever think about following up again. After creating and assigning a task to an employee, the software will take care of everything and you can see the progress online as employees just update their tasks real time.
</p>
<p>
9. Access anytime, anywhere
</p>
<p>
If you plan to continue working when you are out of the office or on weekends, but forget some important notes or information at your workplace, you’ll have to go back and get them. Task tracking  software allows you to access your database anytime from any device: You just need an internet connection.
</p>
<p>
These are just a few examples of the benefits of task tracking software. If you have more than 10 employees, and are already struggling to keep up, it will only become worse as your agency grows.
</p>
<p>
But don’t worry, technology is there to help you out :)</p>
